# Lab Report: Zine around

#### Sabina Stan

## Process Description

This was such a fun lab. We started spreading all these magazines across the table and learned how to fold a piece of printer paper into a little booklet. After this we were able to just let loose and cut up the magazines and any materials we had to create our zines. I was inspired by the example booklet from the Society of American Archivists which folded out. I noticed as I was going through it that there was stuff on the inside of the folds, so I started to fold it out and flip it around to see. 

I started to decorate it by just cutting out the things that I was finding that made me happy. I did full page ones since I'm not actually a huge fan of the cut and paste look that a lot of zines have. I don't think they need to be super bland and cookie-cutter perfect, but it's just not my favourite thing. So I didn't do it and focused on these big images. I was first caught by the front of a magazine that had the ocean on it, since I miss home. Then I found artwork I liked, a photo of bookshelves, and it sort of all developed from there. I did a very loose gradient of light colours to darker ones but it's not so noticeable. I cut out a poem but I decided in the end that I didn't actually want to stick it in, it didn't feel like the overall look of it. When I was flipping through it, I realized that my booklet was doing the same as the practice and naturally opening a bit on the inside seam. With this I decided to write "The Things that make me Happy are Hidden" on the inside. I wrote it sideways on a vertical so that if you twist it and hold it to open it, it won't fully open to a flat piece of paper. After this you can pull the two pieces apart, and in there I have listed a bunch of things that make me happy, focusing on stuff that was in the images, like books, the ocean, art, colours, and rain. I wrote Find me on the cover, I made it a little difficult to see the Find (I wrote it on the darker section) so it looks like Me on first glance. 


## Observations

I had a bit of trouble with the folding at first but luckily the people around me quickly showed me what I was doing. 

I wrote a bit already about how I don't like the typical Zine look, but I'm really happy with how mine came about. I actually have kept it in my backpack pouch. I know that that it's not the typical zine since it's not helping anyone or really useful at all, but I like that it's a little zine just for me. I think I could actually get a lot of use out of that in my personal life, making these little books of things that make me happy. Maybe that can still keep it useful as a zine? 


## Analysis
I have to say I didn't have much of an opinion about zines before this lab, and what I did know was mainly that it was sort of slap dash stuff or things like bad poetry (sorry...). I've been pleasantly surprised by what I've learned since then. One thing though, I still am not a fan of blackout poetry. Maybe I just haven't found pieces that really resonate with me, but even the reading couldn't fully change my mind on that. It feels like stealing other work in some way. I think I would be quite upset if someone did that to my poetry. I don't feel that it is transformative enough. For this reason I didn't include it in my zine. But for example, I cut a poem out of Spectrum not knowing it was the girl sitting two chairs down from me. How would she have felt if I blacked out her words to change the meaning? I think this can speak to zine culture at large as well. Maybe that's also why I'm not a fan of the cut and paste style.
