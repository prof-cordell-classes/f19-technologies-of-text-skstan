# Lab Report: Text as Data/Corpus

#### Sabina Stan

## Process Description

These labs were really difficult to write up. I decided to combine them both to try and make my life easier. I also decided to cut out the majority of the process description. I took so many notes in class but I realized most of them aren't actually useful for this lab report, and  they were more for my own personal use if I decided to do something like this again. 
In this lab we were looking mainly at how we can analyze a text for patterns. There was some initial groundwork of how the code works and what r studio is, and how to bring files in from project Gutenberg. We looked at what were the most popular words and how many times they happened in grouping of words (ngram). In the second lab we looked at what these words were, and their attributes (happy, sad, etc.).


## Observations

I think I did alright in the coding on the piece. There were a few times that I missed something obvious that tripped me up, or didn't read the instructions fully but that's on me. I wish we had gotten to spend more time on this, maybe with a smaller topic or more days so that we could write the coding ourselves and figure it out more. I think this would have helped me remember the process better for the second lab. I found the the idea of a stop word list really interesting, that seems like something that could come in handy in the future for me. I also was really intrigued by the sentiment dictionaries. I think those must have a lot of debate surrounding them due to the subjective nature of them. I guess a community edited one would make the most sense. 


## Analysis

I really enjoyed the Padua reading for this lab. I didn't understand the comic always, but the section where the book was chopped up into data was quite reminiscent of this for me. I'm not a big believer in coding as languages (Re my capstone), this project, with the reading, really showed me how you can use it for analysis for the social sciences. I really hadn't seen this much in my time at Northeastern so it was great to have the chance to learn how I could use some of these skills before I ended up graduating.
