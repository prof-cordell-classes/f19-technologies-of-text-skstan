# Lab Report: Electronic Literature

#### Sabina Stan 

## Process Description

We learned about Twine in this lab. This is a really interesting programme you can use to create text based games and similar storyline-focused activities. It's bit like robust flow charts. We started by going through an example of Moby Dick to see how the functionality worked and what options were available to us. This was the most helpful but I think I'd have to make a list until I got more familiar with them all so I could easily reference them. I tried to make a story for my current capstone project. I wanted to make basically a virtual family tree but I struggled with linking that and then I couldn't add media so that was a bust. I ended up doing a little funny one on my bunny PJ, and how he had all these different names. I again wanted to add pictures though. Finally I started one on how inches suck and are a bad form of measurement but I didn't get very far. I was experimenting with the field options and entering information, but I really wanted to then have the ability to add equations which I couldn't figure out. The problem may lie with my ambition and not the program. 

## Observations

I really struggled to just be creative enough for this assignment. At the end of the semester I don't have much left in my brain to work with so I really didn't have any good ideas. I kept wanting to do things that were restrained by the materials, like add media. I also found it frustrating I couldn't drag links to each box and then edit them after. I got a bit fed up with having to repeat typing the links in each time. 

## Analysis

The football reading was one of my favorites for the entire class. Seeing how twine works and how I could use that to make something similar was invigorating. I tried to use it in class to work on my final project but not being able to include photos was a roadblock for that particular work. I couldn't think of many good ideas on the spot for how to use it but I'm very glad I've got it in my back pocket for when I need that functionality. I don't think I could be nearly as creative as the football story but maybe someday I'll create a game on there.
