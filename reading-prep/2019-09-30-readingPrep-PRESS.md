# Reading Prep: CHAPTER 4: PRESS

## Questions or Observations

1. The assumed dock in pay as soon as a woman is introduced to publishing is interesting. I don't fully understand why, is it because women would automatically be paid less? Or is it because there is an increase in size of the workforce so there's less money to go around? I don't quite follow the explanation given later either. I think it is that women would just be paid less out of principal. 

2. I was surprised to see a woman's name at the bottom of the letter. I had assumed it was a man writing, and was shocked that there was such a forward thinking one, but it was also a good feeling, like there was one guy in printing who was ahead of his time. Somehow, having a woman write this letter is a bit deflating. Women have been the spearhead of feminism and pushing for equal pay and rights, and I suspect that this letter wouldn't have been taken as seriously since it was written by a woman. I guess it was unconscious bias that made me assume it was a man, that I had thought that only writing from a guy would be of consequence. 

3. I had an assignment this week where if I used one exclamation mark I'd be docked points, so this is a very interesting contrast. Just thinking back to the printing lab as well, it must have been difficult to find that many exclamation marks (Ah yes, I spoke too soon, I just saw that it was mentioned in the text). I think that this is interesting, it's almost a deliberate action of taking up space, of being inconvenient  to the printer. I think the exclamation marks are also interesting when compared to how we type now. A lot of texts have !!!!! to emphasize a point, and there is even the "emphasize" option on iMessage where you can add !! in a bubble above a message to show you "emphasize" it.
