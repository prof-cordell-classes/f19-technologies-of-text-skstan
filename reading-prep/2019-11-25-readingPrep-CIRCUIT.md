## Questions or Observations

All throughout this reading I was struck by my own thoughts and experiences when I first got a kindle. Being a voracious reader my entire life, traveling with at least 3 books since I would finish one on the flight there and one on the flight back, and I needed one to read while on the holiday itself, I'm sure the Kindle seemed like a logical gift (and one so that I wouldn't constantly be filling my suitcase or my parents' suitcase with heavy books). I absolutely hated it I'm sorry to say. The weight didn't feel right, I hated that the page would invert as you changed the page, flipping the background to black and the text to white. I hated not having the covers, being able to dog-ear the text, having the satisfaction of closing it when I was done. I don't think I even finished a book on the Kindle. I don't mean to sound ungrateful. I was surprised when Mod enjoyed the kindle so much at the start of the article. As I've gotten older, I've lost time for reading books,  mostly reading textbooks for homework or articles online. I miss the physical book, I miss traveling with it as something to do rather than listening to music or sleeping (although my increasingly bad motion sickness plays into that). He also brings up good points about DRM. I don't know what books are on my kindle and I can't be bothered to find it and check. I do know the books that I read as a child because they're all still on my shelf, I'll flip them open and find notes from 14-year old Sabina. I love that. This article has kept me a firm believer in physical books instead of digital, and I don't anticipate that changing anytime soon.

Going off of my previous point, I would like to talk about the magical bookshelf and digital media in general. I think we're too constrained by trying to make digital writing and books something close to what we already know. We must keep the good things in mind, but expand outside the box, or bookshelf, and explore the possibilities that are afforded to us with technology, not focus on what we already have. The magic bookshelf sounded really neat, I'm not sure I fully understood the entire thing from the article I would have loved a visual. But the biggest thing that stands out to me, is why not just go and grab the book off the shelf and flip through it? Maybe I'm tired and missing the point.
 
3. Football reading
Wow this is wild. At first I was thinking why on earth are we reading this mundane article on sports. I'm going to just do my running commentary here as I go through it. I'm on June 44 and the "I love you too" just hits me in the gut. We respond to affection and seek love everywhere I think. It feels very human, which I don't yet know if we are. Am I meant to be Nine? It's quite confusing. Back to scrolling down.
	I'm struck by how quickly I can scroll through the months and the time but I can't imagine waiting that long between your only contact. 
	The "buddy" stuck out to me. Not sure what to make of that yet. Also I should probably be trying to count the days in between messages to see if it's true what they said but...Yeah. 
	Gosh holding still for 27 years. Also very odd that they said holding still, and they know days like this. 
	I love the 'shit' right after that message. 
	Okay so 48. We don't know 1948 or 3048 or 10,048 or *9&48 or what. But from January 17, 48, Nine would have to wait until January 30, 75. Let's see what happens.
	Also it's odd the names nine and ten. Are there more, why is the lower number the one who doesn't know? Surely they would be around for longer? Very confusing. 
	Bugger nine messed up again I'm not going to bother with the maths. 
	Oh gosh now it's all topsy turvy, When they said artifacts in data storage, they must mean people. 

Now I'm just intrigued and I'm in deep. I think this is reading a bit like the article.

	I really didn't like Juice at first but now I'm with it. 

Goodness it's finally over. Texting my friends and reading this I feel weird, like one of the satellites. I can't contain all my thoughts here, I'm excited for the discussion.
