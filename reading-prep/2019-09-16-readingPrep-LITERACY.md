# Reading Prep: CHAPTER 2: LITERACY 

#### Sabina Stan

## Questions or Observations

1. Right off the bat one of the things I’m noticing in the Aelfric piece, and this has been echoed in other antiquated writings, is the emphasis on repeated information. Things that have already been said, and is now being immoralised in the text. It’s interesting since we really don’t have that with texting I think ( or nearly to this extent). Where in his piece, he reiterates their previous conversation, almost to remind the person he is writing to? Or perhaps they had an idea that this might be kept longer. I think that is why I’m interested, in why they make the choice to really fill out the information. In some ways, it reads more like a diary because of it. Having researched what an ealderman is, it seems that they are a royal scribe of sorts, and so I guess the pries is worried about any mistranslations, even just getting the feeling incorrect, since it will be going to a higher power and possibly spread farther. 


2. In the Butler reading, I had noticed the lack of speech before they narrator mentioned the whole ‘body language is the only language’, but what I found really interesting was when the bus driver screamed it seemed like he didn’t have words in the yell. I suppose you could always just make a noise in a shout instead of a word like HEY, but they still seem to be words in some way. Like variations on Hey, or Yo, or Ah! And the lack of recognition of words, but she still seems to be able to comprehend his meaning. 
It’s also very interesting, this virus is said to affect language, not speech. In theory, then, how is she having these coherent thoughts? Shouldn’t they be in some form of these physical gestures that they are all making? In a way, the gestures are a language but I might be nitpicking. It’s also incredibly frustrating reading and not seeing the gestures. Like when she is trying to bring him home, what are the different series?? I guess this could be compared to some disabilities and the struggles involved with literature that is created only with able-bodied people in mind. 

3. 
My instinct is to push back on coding as literacy. I was thinking of arguments like, Can code convey the feeling and beauty that writing and words can? But then, surely those words are just creating imagines in our minds, and code is just creating images on screens. I do believe it is a language, but I’m not sure it can be treated in the same way as writing. You may go your entire life without needing to code, but can you go your entire life without writing anything? 
	Hmm. I’m not sure I agree with their definition of literacy but I’m going to keep an open mind and hear what people say in class about it. I think there will be lots of opinions.
