## Questions or Observations

1. Uzanne reading
This world seems awful to me. I recognize part of this reading is showing how we are partially there, but I'll come back to that. There are plenty of people like me who are not auditory learners. If I'm told instructions I can barely remember them. I get lost in audiobooks, having to constantly rewind. I even use subtitles in movies and TV shows as I find I understand more. This auditory only world takes that away. On the flip side, this would be a more rosy prospect for a blind reader, but not so for a deaf one. 
We do have plenty of these technologies available. Podcasts are increasing in popularity, audiobooks are advertised everywhere, and most people will watch a video over read a post on facebook. Slowly we are turning away from print media, but I don't think books will ever go away. I disagree with our narrator here, there is a happiness in reading. My eyes don't get tired of books, I enjoy it as I would scenery. Reading and listening are different sensations with different correlating media. One is not interchangeable with the other. 

2. Hendren reading
I was really excited for this reading, and I find myself agreeing as I read it. I especially enjoyed the section on how assistive technology is really technology for everyone. As I mentioned above, I use subtitles and captions on videos, even though I can hear perfectly well. I find it really frustrating when videos don't have these accommodations as well. 
One thing that came to mind when they said medical treatments are 'medicalized' is the plastic straw debate. A hugely overlooked aspect of it is that some people NEED straws. If you take that away, for one you're placing the burden of having that on their person at all times on the disabled person. How many times have you been somewhere and ended up going to grab some food with your friend unexpectedly? Secondly, there isn't a reusable alternative that meets all the same criteria as a plastic straw. They aren't even the worst thing for the environment! I think the worst part of it all though is that the disabled community wasn't really considered when banning something that was first and foremost created and marketed as a medical device.

Jessica Kellgren-Fozard is an incredible disabled YouTube and she does amazing informative videos, and has a lovely English accent to listen to. 

I had written about this for another class - I only see myself as disabled for those who are abled. I only began to use the term to get the accommodations I need. Not everyone is trying to be 'normal', this is my normal. The only reason I get ashamed of my disability and needing help or wearing a mobility aid is because of how 'normal' people have reacted to me. 

3. 99% Invisible reading
I actually chose to read this instead of listening because of speed. I could read it in far less time than the 43 minutes of listening. I also do speed up videos sometimes since things just don't happen fast enough, I think the points raised in this piece are very valid. I'm intrigued by the Optophone. It makes sense that it would be helpful, I think I can see it being successful. I wonder though if still you can't get things fast enough, since the words are still spelt out. When you read quickly, it's not the individual letters you are seeing. But I'm guessing certain 'bars' of sound would be identifiable, just like musical chords or words. 'The' 'and' 'of' would be ones that you could know without paying attention to the T sound then the H sound then the E sound.
