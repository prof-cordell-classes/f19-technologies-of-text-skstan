## Questions or Observations

1. Fugitive Verses article
I liked this as it showed a practical way that data analysis is working with literature and getting results. It seems incredible that there are so much content in newspapers that seems to be missed out on in academia, especially like the poem missing from the hNorton Anthology. I know that as a collection, it will invariably miss some things and is by no means perfect, but it is generally seen as a standard for collections.

2. What Gets Counted Counts reading 
This isn't a main part of the piece at all, but their section on race was interesting to me. I've discussed this before in rhetoric classes, it's actually used as an example for something I can't remember, but in Bermuda we really have three races - Black, White, and Portuguese. It's widespread, someone from the Azores (in the past few decades a large part of the population has been immigrants from the Azores, a small archipelago also in the Atlantic that is a Portuguese territory). My last boyfriend was Portuguese, and he would refer to himself as that instead of white which is very common for the island. It does open wider questions of what counts as white, caucasian, etc. I just find it interesting that we've basically created a race out of a nationality. It's used both in a negative and positive sense.
The body scanner is also interesting in this piece, specifically the measurements. I think this might also be considered fatphobic, I wonder if it does cause more patdowns if you're outside the preconceived size or measurements of a 'normal' female. 
It's really scary that men are put first simply because the engineers are mainly male and didn't think ? I didn't know that was how Facebook worked and I'm pretty shocked. 

3. Fugitive verse examples 
I wonder if some of the beauty in writing is not knowing the one who wrote it. 
A Woman's answer to a Man's question - I chose this since it reminded me of "Men without women" by Murakami, A book that I WISH I could discuss in a class, I think it's ripe for that. I flip flop on my thoughts on this, it seems sometimes as a progressive thing for the time, like not wanting to just be a cook, but at the same time it follows the stereotypical thoughts that a woman only cares about the heart and men do not. I wonder why it wasn't credited often, we have the name here and the introduction makes it seem like it was known who wrote it at the time. I guess it's just enough that people assume it was written by a woman. 

If I should die tonight - It seems interesting I've selected poems by two female authors based only on the titles. This poem reminds me of one my great-aunt wrote, they both have the same haunting feel. It also reminds me of When you are Old by Yeats. I think this poem would also be clearly identifiable as written by a female from the physical descriptions and the ideas of gender at the time. It's haunting, and I really like the ending.
